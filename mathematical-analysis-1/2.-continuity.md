# 2. Continuity

### Definition 0. continuous

A function $$f$$ is continuous at the point $$a$$, if for any neighborhood $$V (f (a))$$ of its value $$f (a)$$ at a there is a neighborhood $$U(a)$$ of a whose image under the mapping$$ f$$ is contained in $$V (f (a))$$.

### Definition 1. uniformly continuous



A function $$f : E \to \mathbb R$$ is uniformly continuous on a set $$E \subset \mathbb R$$ if for every $$\varepsilon > 0$$ there exists $$\delta > 0$$ such that $$|f (x_1)−f (x_2)| < \varepsilon $$for all points $$x_1,x_2\in E$$ such that$$ |x_1 − x_2| < \delta$$.

## Mean-value theorem

### Heine–Cantor theorem



if $$f : M \to N$$ is a continuous function between two metric spaces, and $$M$$ is compact, then $$f $$ is uniformly continuous. An important special case is that every continuous function from a closed bounded interval to the real numbers is uniformly continuous.



### Heine theorem



The limit $$\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=b$$'s a necessary and sufficient condition for $$\forall
