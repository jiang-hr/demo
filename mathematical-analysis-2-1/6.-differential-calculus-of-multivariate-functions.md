# 6. Differential calculus of multivariate functions

### Definition 1:

Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ be normed spaces. A mapping $$f: E \rightarrow Y$$ of a set $$E \subset X$$ into $$Y$$ is differentiable at an interior point $$x \in E$$ if there exists a continuous _**linear transformation**_ $$L(x): X \rightarrow Y$$ such that

$$
f(x+h)-f(x)=L(x) h+\alpha(x ; h)
$$

where $$\alpha(x ; h)=o(h)$$ as $$h \rightarrow 0, x+h \in E$$.

We often denote that $$L(x)$$as $$\mathrm{d} f(x), D f(x)$$, or $$f^{\prime}(x)$$.

> remark: If the condition for differentiability of the mapping $$f$$ at some point $$a$$ is written as
>
> $$f(x)-f(a)=L(x)(x-a)+\alpha(a ; x)$$where $$\alpha(a;x) = o(x âˆ’ a)$$ as $$x \to a$$.
